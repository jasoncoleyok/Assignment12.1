# Assignment 12.1 Create a Maze
This XR development assignment employs Unity’s XR toolkit and Pro Builder package to build a VR environment with an interactable key that produces and win state. The assignment familiarizes students with Unity’s XR Rig components, locomotion systems, and Interactors, as well as utilizing GitHub for version control.

## Screenshots of Environmental Requirements
The first screenshot below illustrates many of the environmental requirements for this project:  namely, a minimum of four turns, two dead ends, and object alignment with grid.

## Challenges
-	Assets had to be scaled to fit grid dimensions, which creates an oversized environment that gives the first-person perspective of a child
-	Navigating GitHub and GitHub Desktop were challenging, but I was able to reach out to the instructor and take a short Coursera course on GitHub.  Nonetheless, uploading my Unity Project was the most technically challenging part of the project for me

## Crediting Project Assets
For this project, I used assets from Pixel Modern Office Extras.  In order to snap these assets to the grid, I had to rescale many assets (i.e., doors, walls, rugs, etc.).
